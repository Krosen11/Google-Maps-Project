# Google-Maps-Project
The purpose of this project is to pull in data from the Google Maps API, show the user some information, and allow the user to interact with the map.
Using the Maps API, this project gives the user multiple points of interaction.
  1. Can search using the "Places" search box to search for food, ATMs, doctors, etc. around the current search location.
  2. Can change the search radius.
  3. Can change the search location.
  4. Can click on the Places that show up to see what the places are.
  5. The user can drag the map and zoom in/out of the map as well, moving it around to see the surrounding area
  6. If more than 20 results are in the search radius, there is a "Display More Results" button that allows the user to show more results (up to 60 at a time).
  
To use this website, make sure you have main.html, map.js, and maps.css in the same folder. Then you simply need to open main.html.
For best results, please open in a browser that allows for the website to get your current location.
